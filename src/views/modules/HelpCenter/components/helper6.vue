    <!-- Introduction Section -->
    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-7xl">Introduction</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl leading-snug">
        The website services are provided by PP88. To ensure a safe and pleasant service experience for our customers, we ask you to carefully read this "Privacy Policy," which involves matters related to the use of your personal information. We approach the privacy of our customers with a rigorous attitude.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl leading-snug mt-4">
        To enjoy further services, we may sometimes require you to provide personal information. This policy will cover the use of such personal information and the recording procedures involved. Sometimes, before accepting further services, you may need to provide personal information (such as name, mailing address, email address, membership number, telephone or mobile number, date of birth, or payment information). In any case, we will process your personal information in accordance with this policy. When using your personal information, we will apply current legal provisions and strive to handle it in the best and safest way possible.
      </p>

      <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl leading-snug mt-4">
        We will also monitor your activities on our website, which may include your visit frequency, pages visited, the original domain name of the internet service, etc. This will help us establish a personal data profile for our customers. Some of this data will be aggregated, meaning that we will not be able to examine it individually.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Purpose Section -->
    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-7xl">Purpose</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl leading-snug">
        When you open an account on our platform, we will ask you to provide certain personal information, such as name, mailing address, email address, password, and confirm whether you are over 18 years old (GPE only accepts customers who are legally aged 18 or above). We may use your personal information to confirm various financial transactions, regularly send company updates, provide customer support, and offer comprehensive gambling services to you. If you wish to stop receiving company updates, you can make relevant choices in the newsletter reception options. Please note that the name you register must be your own and the date you register must be true and valid, as this will be used for subsequent transaction verification and other mentioned purposes.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Access Information Section -->
    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-7xl">Access Information</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl leading-snug">
        During your visit to our website, a small text file called a "cookie" will be stored on your computer. Many websites use this method because it is very useful for publishers, for example, to determine if the computer (or user) has visited the site before. We will record the "cookies" and IP addresses of our customers, which will help us improve and enhance our services and assist us in analyzing complete customer information. This type of data is not used for creating personal files of customers and will be regularly cleared.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Confidentiality Section -->
    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-7xl">Confidentiality</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl leading-snug">
        PP88 will do its utmost to protect the personal information provided by our customers and will not intentionally disclose this data to outsiders, unless explicitly stated in this policy. All PP88 employees are required to follow this policy. Employees are obligated to strictly keep customer personal information confidential, even after leaving PP88. You must also protect your personal information. You should keep your account password confidential and not disclose it to others.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Recipients Section -->
    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-7xl">Recipients of Customer Information</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl leading-snug">
        In addition to the statutory requirements mentioned above, we may disclose your personal information to our staff, staff of other related companies, PP88 partners, and third-party network service providers (including but not limited to security, credit, and risk review agencies) who provide relevant services to PP88 customers. Third-party network service providers can check any details we provide in public or private databases and have the opportunity to obtain and retain inspection records. We can also obtain your personal information through third-party network service providers. If you provide your personal information to us or we receive your personal information from third-party network service providers, it means you have agreed that we can process, use, record, and disclose your personal information. We reserve the right, based on the information provided by you or third-party network service providers, to freeze or close your PP88 member account at any time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Monitoring Section -->
    <div>
      <h2 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4 text-7xl">Monitoring</h2>
      <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl leading-snug">
        For service quality assurance, fraud prevention, and regulatory compliance, we will save and monitor customer communications records (such as telephone and email records). Customers have the right to request that we not use their personal information directly for marketing purposes. If you wish to exercise this right, you should prepare the following: a written application providing information that can prove your identity (such as account number, username, registration information), and specify what personal information is incorrect and what needs to be corrected. Acceptance of the Privacy Protection Rules Once a customer registers an account with PP88, it means you agree to the terms of this privacy policy. We will regularly update this policy, so we recommend that you also regularly review it. If we make changes to this policy, we will post a message on the relevant webpage. Continued use of the PP88 website after policy changes will be considered as your acceptance of the changes to the policy. If you do not accept the changes to this policy, you can choose to stop using our website services. If there is a discrepancy between this policy and other specific local terms, the specific local terms will apply.
