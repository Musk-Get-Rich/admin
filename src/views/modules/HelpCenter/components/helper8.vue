          <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium text-6xl">1. Why are members who registered through my promotional link under another agent's line?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl mt-2">
            The member might have registered earlier; you can consult customer service to check the member's registration time. Or the member might have consulted other agents and used another agent's link to register.
          </p>

        <div>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium text-6xl">2. Where can I view my transfer line records?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl mt-2">
            The transfer line page displays your current month and historical cumulative transfer data. Click "View Details" to see all transfer line records.

        <div>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium text-6xl">3. Why was my application not approved?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl mt-2">
            The screenshots you uploaded may not prove that the member was recruited by you. We suggest you upload images with time, promotional URL, member account, etc., for quick review by the administrator.

        <div>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium text-6xl">4. What if the member makes a deposit during the waiting period for review?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl mt-2">
            During the waiting period for review, the member's deposits and bets are not affected. After the transfer is successful, all records of the member's deposits and bets during the review period will be displayed in your report.
