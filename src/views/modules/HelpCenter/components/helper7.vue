      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium text-6xl">1. Why are members not registering under my subordinates?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl mt-2">There could be several reasons for members not registering under your subordinates:</p>
          <div class="ml-8 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl">A. The member removed the dealer number from the URL.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl">B. The link was opened in a third-party app and then redirected to the default browser, causing the registration to be untracked.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl">C. Due to certain device models, switching apps during registration and returning to the registration browser can cause an automatic refresh, and registering after the refresh can lead to untracked registration.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl">D. The member has already registered (you can contact customer service to inquire about the member's registration time).</p>
          </div>
          <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl mt-2">
            For the issues above, except D, situations A, B, and C leading to untracked registration can be resolved by submitting chat screenshots (with link, date, time) through the agent backend to request a transfer.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium text-6xl">2. What is a short link?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl mt-2">
            Short links are used for special communication software. Some communication or social software may block websites, so short links can be used to avoid blocking. They also allow for visit tracking, so you can monitor the use of the short link. Note: Changing the short link will reset the tracking data.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium text-6xl">3. How to apply for a dedicated URL?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl mt-2">
            Dedicated URLs will be opened for domain applications periodically, and applications will be processed within 1-5 working days.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium text-6xl">4. What is the difference between a dedicated URL and a regular registration URL?</p>
          <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl mt-2">
            Regular URLs need to carry the dealer number to register under the agent. We have optimized regular URLs so that even if a member opens them through communication software and then jumps to the default browser, the dealer number can still be carried. This is a challenge that other platforms cannot overcome! A dedicated URL can register under the agent without carrying the dealer number.

        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="text-gray-700 font-medium text-6xl">5. Things to note for dedicated domains:</p>
          <div class="ml-8 mt-2 space-y-2">
            <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl">A. Applications are approved in chronological order. If your requested domain name is rejected, it means someone else has already applied for it.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl">B. If there are no member registrations for a long time, the dedicated URL will be revoked.</p>
            <p class="text-gray-500 text-6xl">C. Customizing a dedicated URL is not possible; please apply for your desired dedicated URL on the application page</p>
